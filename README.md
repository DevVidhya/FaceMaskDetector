# FinalYearProject
Implemented a Single Shot Multibox Detector and MobileNetV2 (SSDMNV2) Transfer Learning model using Keras which attained an accuracy of 98% in localizing and classifying faces into "with mask", "without mask" and "improperly worn mask" when images with a single face are given as input. Also implemented a Faster R-CNN model using Tensorflow which is efficient in localizing and classifying multiple faces in real images into the required three classes.
